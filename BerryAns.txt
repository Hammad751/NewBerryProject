question

Free Minting Sale:

   why 100 card more? total 1,100? where use 100 card?

   NFT will not be showed inminter’ wallet. what mean?

Dutch Minting Sale:

Question:  amount and time check -> bcb 2400 tpken, every 1minute down price.
Answer : Please Increase Price or increase decrement time because in this scenario sale will be ended with in a day. Because amount token is very low and decrement time as well (1 minute). Owner will set starting price and discounted price (price will be decreased after every 1 minutes). 
Question : NFT will not be showed in owner’s wallet.  ? why not show? then when show?
Answer: There are two scenarios; 
Locked Staking. (Free Mint, Dutch Mint)
In this scenario, when user will mint NFT through free mint function or dutch mint function, NFT will be transfer to Staking contract automatically and it will be locked as per requirement that given by owner. This is the reason minter can not see NFT in his wallet but he can check which NFT is staked on minter’s behalf. When time will be completed and user unstake NFT then he can check in his wallet. 
Normal Staking. (Public Mint)
In this scenario, when user will mint NFT he can show in his wallet because we did not set any locked time or staking condition. User can stake NFT manually by calling Stake button.

           only free mint nft and dutch mint nft lock

Genesis Id not Locked.
only free mint and dutch mint is locked



question

what is your question?

genesis nft card, no locke, reward give immediately.
Ok , 

even breed with genesis card, lock work mean.

-> user need two card for genesis card?
    some user can use free mint card or dutch minting card for genesis breed?
   if this included, we need lock reward?

but i think if this takes time, we can allow no lock in this case also.
